AndroidScreenProperties
=======================

## by Kevin Carlson

This repository contains the source for a fairly simple Android application I wrote, to calculate the pixel density of arbitrary displays. I created it to learn the Android development process and Android Studio IDE, as well as for my own use. It is available (for free) in the Google Play Store. The source is available under the terms of the three clause  BSD License.
